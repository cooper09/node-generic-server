# Grifter JS
This shared node.js library provides models and logic shared across grifter services. 
The following outlines the directory structure of the library.

```
grifter
--| adapters/
----| <partner name>/
--| core/
--| logging/
--| models/
----| grifter/
----| rtb/

```

The structure is designed to provide flexibility as the need to support various vender specifications.

## Adapaters
The ```adapters``` directory is where partner specific packages are stored. these packages share a structure. The structure of these partner directories is as follows:

```
--| <partner name>/
----| models/
----| handle_bid.js
```

Obviously partner-specific models are stored in the ```models``` directory, but the important thing to note is the ```handle_bid.js``` file. This is expected to be present in each of the partner-specific package, as this is the primary operation performed by the RTB. I point this out to illustrate the intent of encapsulating partner related behaviour into a consistent package.

## Core
This is where the engine and critical business logic is stored. 

## Logging
This directory provides a universal logging module, to be shared across Grifter project. It will encapsulate the third party logging solutions we select and allow us to change that provider with minimal impact on dependant projects.

## Models
This is where all non-partner related models are defined. In this directory there are currently two subdirectories as follows:

```
--| grifter
--| rtb
```

Each of these folders contain models used in the RTB. As the names indicate ```grifter``` directory contains grifter specific modesl and ```rtb``` contains models based on the Open RTB spec.
