 Seat Bid
 A bid response can contain multiple SeatBid objects, each on behalf of a different bidder seat and each containing one or more individual bids. If multiple impressions are presented in the request, the group attribute can be used to specify if a seat is willing to accept any impressions that it can win (default) or if it is only interested in winning any if it can win them all as a group.
