/**
 Device Type
 The following table lists the type of device from which the impression originated.
 OpenRTB version 2.2 of the specification added distinct values for Mobile and Tablet. It is recommended that any bidder adding support for 2.2 treat a value of 1 as an acceptable alias of 4 & 5.
 This OpenRTB table has values derived from the Inventory Quality Guidelines (IQG). Practitioners should keep in sync with updates to the IQG values.
