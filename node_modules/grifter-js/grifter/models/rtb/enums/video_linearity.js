/**
 Video Linearity
 The following table indicates the options for video linearity. “In-stream” or “linear” video refers to pre- roll, post-roll, or mid-roll video ads where the user is forced to watch ad in order to see the video content. “Overlay” or “non-linear” refer to ads that are shown on top of the video content.
 This OpenRTB table has values derived from the Inventory Quality Guidelines (IQG). Practitioners should keep in sync with updates to the IQG values.
