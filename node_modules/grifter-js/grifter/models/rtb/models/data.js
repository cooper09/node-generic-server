Data
The data and segment objects together allow additional data about the user to be specified. This data
may be from multiple sources whether from the exchange itself or third party providers as specified by
the id field. A bid request can mix data objects from multiple providers. The specific data providers in
use should be published by the exchange a priori to its bidders.
